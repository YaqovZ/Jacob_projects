This is a simple web scraper using Beautiful Soup extracting data of Premnier League matches. 
The final function in the file allows the user to enter two years and retrieve a csv document containing the match data between the two years.
The data are originally ordered by the clubs.
In the repository you can see a sample file in csv format, which contains the data of 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons.
Improvements are welcome!
